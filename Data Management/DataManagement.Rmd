Subset for H1DA5 that did play a sport    
Can't get H1DA8 and H1DA10 blanks to go into subset

## Purpose of the study
```{r}
library(PDS)
```
## Variables
```{r}
addhealth.subset <-AddHealth[AddHealth$H1DA5 == 0,]
library(Hmisc)
label(AddHealth$H1DA5) <- "Number of times playing sports this week"
label(AddHealth$H1DA8) <- "Hours spent watching TV"
label(AddHealth$H1DA10) <- "Hours spent playing videogames"
library("descr")

summary(AddHealth$H1DA8)
AddHealth$H1DA8[AddHealth$H1DA8 == 996] <- NA
AddHealth$H1DA8[AddHealth$H1DA8 == 998] <- NA
summary(AddHealth$H1DA8)

freq(as.ordered(AddHealth$H1DA5))
freq(as.ordered(AddHealth$H1DA8))
hist(AddHealth$H1DA8, xlab = "Hours per week", 
     main = "Watching TV", col = "red")
freq(as.ordered(AddHealth$H1DA10))

```
