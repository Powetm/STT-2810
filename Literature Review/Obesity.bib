	abstract = {Observational studies of the relationship between {TV} viewing and health outcomes (overweight/obesity, cholesterol/lipids, blood pressure/hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome) in adults are reviewed. Studies indicate that in adults, greater amounts of {TV} viewing are consistently associated with increased overweight risk, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, but that results are mixed regarding the relationship between adult {TV} viewing and other health outcomes. It is theorized that greater {TV} viewing is related to increased weight status and poorer health outcomes by reducing energy expenditure, predominantly through reducing time spent in physical activity, and increasing energy intake. No randomized trials that manipulated {TV} viewing time measured the effects of this manipulation on diet and physical activity and then measured future health outcomes in adults. However, experimental studies, predominantly conducted in children, show relationships between {TV} viewing, energy intake, physical activity, and weight status, which follow the hypothesized mechanisms. Interventions targeting {TV} viewing in adults appear to be justified, and proposed methods for conducting these interventions, as well as potential barriers to implementing these interventions, are discussed.[/italic},

	abstract = {To understand and document children's stated experiences and beliefs about television and to elicit their suggestions for alternative activities.
Eleven focus groups were conducted with 51 Anglo and Latino children, ages 7-10, in a large Northern California city. Philosophical underpinnings of developmental psychology were the basis for multiphase thematic analysis. Data were collected in 1998-1999.
Themes were identified in five conceptual categories. Findings showed that children did not perceive many parental rules related to {TV} watching, rather daily routines are associated with {TV} viewing. Children revealed both covert and overt motivations for watching. Nearly all participants spoke of the deception of advertising, but they were unclear about the role of commercial sponsors in payment for {TV} shows. Children perceived both negative physical and behavioral health effects of {TV} and they had great difficulty imagining life without a {TV}.
Children perceived television as providing educational and relational needs. Although they preferred alternatives to {TV}, they had difficulty articulating and getting those needs met. Clinicians and researchers can utilize these findings to design health interventions that attenuate the health-impairing effects of habitual sedentary activity in childhood.},

	abstract = {Successful childhood obesity interventions frequently focus on behavioral modification and involve parents or family members. Parental confidence in supporting behavior change may be an element of successful family-based prevention efforts. We aimed to determine whether parents' own obesity-related behaviors were related to their confidence in supporting their child's achievement of obesity-related behavioral goals. Cross-sectional analyses of data collected at baseline of a randomized control trial testing a treatment intervention for obese children (n = 787) in primary care settings (n = 14). Five obesity-related behaviors (physical activity, screen time, sugar-sweetened beverage, sleep duration, fast food) were self-reported by parents for themselves and their child. Behaviors were dichotomized on the basis of achievement of behavioral goals. Five confidence questions asked how confident the parent was in helping their child achieve each goal. Logistic regression modeling high confidence was conducted with goal achievement and demographics as independent variables. Parents achieving physical activity or sleep duration goals were significantly more likely to be highly confident in supporting their child's achievement of those goals (physical activity, odds ratio 1.76; 95\% confidence interval 1.19-2.60; sleep, odds ratio 1.74; 95\% confidence interval 1.09-2.79) independent of sociodemographic variables and child's current behavior. Parental achievements of {TV} watching and fast food goals were also associated with confidence, but significance was attenuated after child's behavior was included in models. Parents' own obesity-related behaviors are factors that may affect their confidence to support their child's behavior change. Providers seeking to prevent childhood obesity should address parent/family behaviors as part of their obesity prevention strategies.},

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate ecological correlates of the development of overweight in a multisite study sample of children followed from age 2 to 12. Design: Longitudinal examination of covariates of overweight status throughout childhood, with covariates drawn from three ecological levels: sociocultural or demographic, quality of the child's home environment, and proximal child experience that could directly affect the balance between energy intake and energy expenditure. Subjects: A total of 960 children participating in a long-term longitudinal study provided growth data at least once; 653 of the children had complete data on covariates. Measurements: Height and weight measured seven times between ages 2 and 12 were converted to a body mass index ({BMI}) and entered into a latent transition analysis to identify patterns of overweight across childhood. Ecological correlates measured longitudinally included demographic characteristics obtained by maternal report, home environment quality obtained by observation and maternal report, and proximal child experience factors obtained by observation, maternal report and child report. Results: Four patterns of overweight were found: never overweight, overweight beginning at preschool age, overweight beginning in elementary school, and return to normal weight after being overweight at preschool age. The weight status groups differed on home environment quality and proximal child experience factors but not on demographics. Children overweight at preschool had less sensitive mothers than never overweight children. Children overweight at school age had fewer opportunities for productive activity at home than did never overweight children. School-age overweight children also watched the most {TV} after school. Multivariate logistic regression analyses further indicated the significance to children's weight status of proximal child experience variables. Less physically active children and those who watched more television after school were more likely to become overweight. Results did not vary by child sex. Conclusion: The results support the idea that childhood overweight is multiply determined. The one potentially important and changeable factor identified as a target for intervention centers on how children spend their time, especially their after-school time. Children who are more physically active and spend less time watching {TV} after school are less likely to become overweight by age 12.},

	abstract = {Background {TV} viewing has been linked to metabolic-risk factors in youth. However, it is unclear whether this association is independent of physical activity ({PA}) and obesity. Methods and Findings We did a population-based, cross-sectional study in 9- to 10-y-old and 15- to 16-y-old boys and girls from three regions in Europe (n = 1,921). We examined the independent associations between {TV} viewing, {PA} measured by accelerometry, and metabolic-risk factors (body fatness, blood pressure, fasting triglycerides, inverted high-density lipoprotein ({HDL}) cholesterol, glucose, and insulin levels). Clustered metabolic risk was expressed as a continuously distributed score calculated as the average of the standardized values of the six subcomponents. There was a positive association between {TV} viewing and adiposity (p = 0.021). However, after adjustment for {PA}, gender, age group, study location, sexual maturity, smoking status, birth weight, and parental socio-economic status, the association of {TV} viewing with clustered metabolic risk was no longer significant (p = 0.053). {PA} was independently and inversely associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, insulin (all p {\textless} 0.01), and triglycerides (p = 0.02). {PA} was also significantly and inversely associated with the clustered risk score (p {\textless} 0.0001), independently of obesity and other confounding factors. Conclusions {TV} viewing and {PA} may be separate entities and differently associated with adiposity and metabolic risk. The association between {TV} viewing and clustered metabolic risk is mediated by adiposity, whereas {PA} is associated with individual and clustered metabolic-risk indicators independently of obesity. Thus, preventive action against metabolic risk in children may need to target {TV} viewing and {PA} separately. A study of over 1,900 European children showed that {TV} viewing and physical activity in children are separately associated with obesity and metabolic risk. Editors' Summary Background. Childhood obesity is a rapidly growing problem. Twenty-five years ago, overweight children were rare. Now, 155 million of the world's children are overweight, and 30-45 million are obese. Both conditions are diagnosed by comparing a child's body mass index ({BMI}; weight divided by height squared) with the average {BMI} for their age and sex. Being overweight during childhood is worrying because it is one of the so-called metabolic-risk factors that increase the chances of developing diabetes, heart problems, or strokes later in life. Other metabolic-risk factors are fatness around the belly, blood-fat disorders, high blood pressure, and problems with how the body uses insulin and blood sugar. Until recently, like obesity, these other metabolic-risk factors were seen only in adults, but now they are becoming increasingly common in children. In the {US}, 1 in 20 adolescents has metabolic syndrome-three or more of these risk factors. Environmental and behavioural changes have probably contributed to the increase in metabolic syndrome in children. As a group, they tend to be less physically active nowadays and they eat bigger portions of energy-dense foods more often. Increased {TV} viewing during childhood (and the use of other media such as computer games) has also been linked to increased obesity and to poorer health as an adult. Why Was This Study Done? One popular theory is that {TV} viewing may affect obesity and other metabolic-risk factors by displacing {PA}. Instead of playing in the yard after school, the theory suggests, children laze about in front of the {TV}. However, there is limited evidence to support this idea, and health professionals need to know whether {TV} viewing and {PA} are related, and how they affect metabolic-risk factors, in order to improve children's health. In this study, the researchers examined the associations between {TV} viewing, {PA}, and metabolic-risk factors in European children. What Did the Researchers Do and Find? The researchers enrolled nearly 2,000 children in two age groups from three areas in Europe. They measured the children's height and weight, estimated how fat they were by measuring skin fold thickness, measured their blood pressure, and examined the levels of glucose, insulin, and different fats in their blood. The children completed a computer questionnaire about the lengths of time for which they watched {TV} and how often they ate while doing so, and their {PA} was measured using a device called an accelerometer that each child wore for four days. When these data were analyzed statistically, the researchers found that {TV} viewing was slightly associated with clustered metabolic risk (the average of the individual metabolic-risk factors). This association was due to an association between {TV} viewing and obesity-the children who watched most {TV} tended to be the fattest children. However, {TV} viewing was not related to {PA}. The most active children were not necessarily those who watched least {TV}. Most importantly, {PA} was related to all individual risk factors except for obesity and with clustered metabolic risk. These associations were independent of obesity. What Do These Findings Mean? These results suggest that {TV} viewing does not damage children's health by displacing {PA} as popularly believed. The finding that the association between {TV} viewing and clustered metabolic-risk factors is mediated by obesity suggests that targeting behaviours like eating while watching {TV} might be a good way to improve children's health. Indeed, the researchers provide some evidence that eating while watching {TV} is associated with being overweight, but the results of this post hoc analysis-one that was not planned in advance-need to be confirmed. Another limitation of the study is the possibility that the children inaccurately reported their {TV} watching habits. Also, because measurements of metabolic-risk factors were made only once, it is impossible to say whether {TV} viewing or lack of {PA} actually causes an increase in metabolic-risk factors. Nevertheless, these results strongly suggest that promoting {PA} is beneficial in relation to metabolic-risk factors, but less so in relation to obesity in childhood. {TV} viewing and {PA} should be treated as separate targets in programs designed to reverse the obesity and metabolic-syndrome epidemic in children.
